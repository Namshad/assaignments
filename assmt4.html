     <P><h2><CENTER><i><u>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</u></i></CENTER></h2>
     <font color="blue">A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</P></font>

  <p><h2><center><i><u>c++</u></i></center></h2>
  	<font color="blue">C++ (pronounced cee plus plus ) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p></font>

  	<p><h2><center><i><u>c</u></i></center></h2>
  		<font color="blue">C (/ˈsiː/,) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p></font>

  		<p><h2><center><i><u>java</u></i></center></h2>
  			<font color="blue"><font color="blue">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</font></>

        <p><h2><center><i><u><font color="black">O2 and life</u></i></center></h2></font>

  				<font color="blue">Oxygen is a very important element because it is a part of the air people breathe and the water people drink. Because of this, oxygen supports life. Many living things (including humans) need oxygen to live and breathe, though it is poisonous to some forms of life.</p></font>
